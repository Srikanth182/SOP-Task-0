The very first chicken in existence would have been result of a genetic mutation.
The genetic mutation taking place in a zygote produced by two almost chickens which are called as proto chickens.
This means two proton chickens mated combining their DNA together.
This resulted to form very first cell of very first chicken.
Somewhere along the line ,genetic mutations occurred in that very first cell.
These mutations copied themselves into every other body cell as the chicken embryo grew.
This results the formation of first chicken without egg.
Hence our result is chicken formed first without egg.
